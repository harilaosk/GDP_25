***Start script***
This is a mock Arduino template
There will be lines of code at the top which we don't want to change

Then there will be some key variables to change below:
key_variable = 
key_variable_2 = 

Then we will get to the main script running through each setting, this will be a variable length
// Add mission cycle here
void setup{
	light_switch(n cycles ls, f max ls, f min, rom max,   rom min) <- written by python
	typing(1)
	end()
}

void light_switch(cycles) <- also written by python
	force = 100
	rom_period = 10
	...

	
	



***End script***
